      <p class="info-box">This is <strong>HWOOGY</strong>: The Heavy Weapons Guy. <br>You might
      be familiar with the normal, pesky ol' heavy weapons guy, but heed this,
    these both are not the same. Heavy is a respectable mercenary however still in
  its early stages, Heavy is like your charizard that hasn't even evolved yet.
Now Hoovy is the evolved version of charizard, the big boy version, but still nothing
 compared to HWOOGY, you see HWOOGY is the gigantamax version of charizard and yes
 I'm sorry for reminding that game to you. <br>However i hope now you understand. </p>

      <p class="info-box">Here we have HWOOGY on the moon. You see it all began
       when HWOOGY was feeling stupid with his couple of friends, metroogy and stroogy,
      <br>HWOOGY decided, wouldn't it be funny to drink liquid hydrogen and combust into the space,
     so that's what he decided to do, he drank the liquid hydrogen and made his way to the moon. <br>
  On the moon he is alone because non of his friends and powerful enough to do what he did but he does have
   his trusty car that he's driving around as seen in the picture. <br><br>The picture for the launch can be seen
 right at the start. </p>

    She's is the evolved version of samus and now can destroy her enemies like one punch man,
   however that's not her legacy. The best part of her life is that she is friends with the
      mighty HWOOGY, which is obviously the best thing about her life. HWOOGY just let's her
    hang around because why not. Otherwise she isn't the hot stuff</p>
